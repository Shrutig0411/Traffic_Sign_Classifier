A model to decode traffic signs using Convolutional Neural Network.
Dataset: German Traffic Sign Classifier , this dataset has 43 classes and more than 50,0000 images.
Dependencies: Jupyter, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Tkinter, PIL, Keras
Steps for the projects are as follows:
1. Load the dataset
2. Explore,summarize and visualize the dataset
3. Design the model architecture 
4. Model training and Evaluation 
5. Buliding GUI for the classifier to test new images( file: gui.ipynb)
